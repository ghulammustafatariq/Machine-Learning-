# Types of Machine Learning Techniques

## Overview
Machine learning techniques are broadly categorized into three types:
- **Supervised Learning**
- **Unsupervised Learning**
- **Reinforcement Learning**

## 1. Supervised Learning

### Definition
Supervised learning uses labeled data, where each data point has input features and a known output (target/dependent feature).

### Key Concepts
- **Independent Features (Input):** e.g., size of house, number of rooms
- **Dependent Feature (Output):** e.g., price of house

### Problem Types
- **Regression:** Output is continuous (e.g., predicting house prices)
- **Classification:** Output is categorical (e.g., pass/fail, multi-class)

#### Examples
- **Regression:** Predicting house prices based on features
- **Classification:** Predicting pass/fail based on study/play hours

### Algorithms
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Elastic Net
- Logistic Regression (for classification)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- AdaBoost
- XGBoost, CatBoost (bagging/boosting)

## 2. Unsupervised Learning

### Definition
Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data (no output feature). The goal is to find patterns, clusters, or groups in the data.

### Key Concepts
- No predefined output labels
- Focus on grouping similar data points

#### Example
- **Customer Segmentation:** Grouping customers by salary and spending score

### Algorithms
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- DBSCAN

## 3. Reinforcement Learning

### Definition
Reinforcement learning enables models to learn by interacting with the environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on actions.

### Key Concepts
- Learning by trial and error
- Rewards and penalties guide learning

#### Example
- A child learning to walk or perform tasks based on feedback

## Key Takeaways
- **Supervised Learning:** Uses labeled data, solves regression and classification problems.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Finds clusters/groups in unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Learns through rewards and penalties.

## Learning Path
1. Start with supervised learning (linear regression, etc.)
2. Move to unsupervised learning (clustering algorithms)
3. Explore reinforcement learning
