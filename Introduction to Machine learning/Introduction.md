# Basic Differences Between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science

## Introduction
Many people have heard the terms **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning**, and **Data Science**, but often confuse their meanings. This guide clarifies the distinctions between these fields.

---

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI is the broadest concept, referring to applications that perform tasks autonomously, without human intervention.

**Examples:**
- **Netflix Recommendation System:** Suggests movies based on your viewing habits.
- **Self-Driving Cars:** Navigate and make decisions without human input.
- **Amazon Shopping Recommendations:** Personalizes product suggestions.

## Machine Learning (ML)
ML is a subset of AI. It uses statistical tools and algorithms to analyze data, make predictions, and perform forecasting.

- ML engineers and data scientists build AI applications using ML techniques.

---

## Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a subset of ML. It uses multi-layered neural networks to mimic human learning.

- Developed to enable machines to learn in a way similar to humans.
- Deep learning developers also create AI applications.

---

## Data Science
Data Science overlaps with AI, ML, and Deep Learning. It involves mathematics, statistics, and various tools for tasks such as exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.

- Data scientists work across all these areas, integrating techniques from each.
